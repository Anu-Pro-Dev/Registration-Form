# Registration-Form
This project delivers a comprehensive registration form design. The design addresses the challenge of creating a unified user experience across multiple input methods (mouse, keyboard, and touch screen) while maintaining accessibility standards and visual excellence across different screen resolutions.
Project Pipeline
1. Requirement Gathering
 Identified the need for a clean, modern user registration form from the shared document.
 Determined required fields: name, email, phone, emirate, and consent checkbox.
2. Wireframing & Layout Planning
 Created low-fidelity sketches (paper and digital).
 Sketched a simple centered form layout to ensure focus and clarity.
 Chose a card-style container with generous white space for readability.
3. Visual Design Decisions
 Decided the brand name and create a logo.
 Applied a soft, blurred background to create depth and draw attention to the form.
 Selected a purple(#703AB3) as a primary color for buttons and branding to maintain a clean, tech-oriented theme.
4. Component Structuring
 Split the form into labelled input fields with placeholders for usability along with focus and error states.
 Added a dropdown for proper user input guidance.
 Create a component for checkbox with 2 states.
5. UX Enhancements
 Used rounded inputs and a single, prominent “Submit” button for smooth interaction.
 Included links to Terms of Use and Privacy Policy for compliance.
6. Final Review & Optimization
 Verified spacing, alignment, and readability across the form.
 Ensured the design remains minimal.
